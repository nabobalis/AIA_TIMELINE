This time only ATA-1 was warmed up, using TSMs 338 & 339 and RTSs 313 & 315.  A special sequence was written so that the filterwheel of ATA-1 was put in the open position while the other 3 ATAs gathered normal science data."

We have been able to mitigate the effect a bit by warming up the CCD, but this has not reversed the underlying trend. In order to determine whether the ongoing decline in sensitivity is related to total EUV dosage, we plan to temporarily reduce the cadence of 304 images from 12 seconds to 60 seconds (with extra 94 Å images taking the place of the dropped 304 images in the observing sequence). We'll plan to run in this mode for about 3 weeks, at which point we'll switch back to the normal observing sequence. The data taken during this period will not be flagged in any special manner (though that could be done if it would be helpful)."
